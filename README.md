# Password-generator

This is a personal project to make a password generator in python and I have added functionality for the program to save the file as a .txt file on the users computer. This file has three levels of password complexity (1 through 3). 1 is the weakest at a minimum character count of 12. While the second option has a minimum character count at 20 characters. The third has a minimum character count of 33 characters and a maximum character count of 51 characters. The program also provides functionality to save the password to an onboard dictionary which can save multiple passwords and gives the user the oppurtunity to name the passwords as well. The program also gives the ability to see the dictionary in its entirety and to print it for the user. The program also provides the user the oppurtunity to make another password in a complexity level of the users choice after the creation of the first password. The user has the ability to manually enter passwords to be saved by the program. The program gives the user the ability to either make a file to store their passwords or if given the name and the file path it will store it onto a preexisting file.
